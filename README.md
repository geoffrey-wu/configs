# configs

A place to store all of my configs for command-line tools like `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `vim`.

I use [fish](https://fishshell.com/) for all of my personal command-line related tasks-except for scripting, which I use bash for portability (and because I'm just starting to learn shell scripting).
